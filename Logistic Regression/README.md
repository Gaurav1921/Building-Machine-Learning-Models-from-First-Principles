# Logistic Regression from Scratch
This repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression from scratch, without using any external libraries. The implementation uses gradient descent to minimize the logistic loss function and predict binary outcomes.

## Installation
To download the code, you can use git to clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
```
This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine. You can then navigate to the repository directory and run the code.

## Files

*logistic_regression.py*: Contains the implementation of logistic regression.

*train.csv*: A sample dataset for training the logistic regression model.

*test.csv*: A sample dataset for testing the logistic regression model.

## Usage
To use the logistic regression implementation, simply import the LogisticRegression class from logistic_regression.py and fit it to your data. Here's an example of how to use the class:

```sh
from logistic_regression import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Load the data
X_train = np.loadtxt('train.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)
y_train = X_train[:, -1]
X_train = X_train[:, :-1]

X_test = np.loadtxt('test.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)

# Fit the model
lr = LogisticRegression(learning_rate=0.1, num_iterations=1000, verbose=True)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Print the predictions
print(y_pred)
```

In this example, we first load the training and test data from CSV files. The training data consists of features and binary labels, while the test data consists only of features. We then create an instance of the LogisticRegression class with a learning rate of 0.1 and 1000 iterations, and fit it to the training data. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the labels of the test data and print the results.

## Documentation
The logistic_regression.py module contains two functions:

"fit_logistic_regression(X, y, alpha, lambda_, num_iterations)": Fits a logistic regression model to the input data using gradient descent with L2 regularization.

## Parameters:

+ X (array-like): An array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing the input features.
+ y (array-like): An array of shape (n_samples,) containing the target values.
+ alpha (float): Learning rate for the gradient descent algorithm.
+ lambda_ (float): Regularization parameter for L2 regularization.
+ num_iterations (int): The number of iterations to run the gradient descent algorithm.

## Returns:

+ tuple: A tuple containing the weight coefficients of the logistic regression model.

"predict_logistic_regression(X, weights)": Predicts target values for new input features using the weight coefficients of a logistic regression model.

## Improvements
The basic implementation provided in logistic_regression.py can be improved in several ways to increase its accuracy:

+ Feature scaling: Scale the input features to have zero mean and unit variance to improve convergence.
+ Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, regularization parameters, and number of iterations to find the best combination for the data.
+ Polynomial features: Add polynomial features to the input data to capture higher-order interactions between the features.
+ Ensemble methods: Combine multiple logistic regression models using bagging or boosting to improve accuracy.
