# Logistic Regression from Scratch
This repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression from scratch, without using any external libraries. The implementation uses gradient descent to minimize the logistic loss function and predict binary outcomes.

## Files

*logistic_regression.py*: Contains the implementation of logistic regression.
*train.csv*: A sample dataset for training the logistic regression model.
*test.csv*: A sample dataset for testing the logistic regression model.

## Usage
To use the logistic regression implementation, simply import the LogisticRegression class from logistic_regression.py and fit it to your data. Here's an example of how to use the class:
